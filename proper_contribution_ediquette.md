#Proper Contribution Ediquette

Open Source Software is an awesome and very powerful way to bring people together to protentially create awesome software that is more often than not, made publicly available for anyone to use and modify at no monetary cost. I am creating this file for every project I manage from now on just to document my opinion on certain areas involved with OSS that I feel has gotten a little lost.

I will begin by restating most OSS can be obtained for *Free* and I anotate the word free on pourpose. The true spirit of OSS and the *Free* aspect of it, IMHO, is if you use someones code and you benefit from it, you should contribute back to the community by contributing back to that project. It takes HOURS & HOURS of hard work, long nights and ZERO pay for most of us developers to offer affordable software and push inovation. 

There are many ways to contribute. There are no set rules on what one has to do, but I will list just a few, in no order of importance or expectancy.

1. Donate Money
	- Donating money is a really great way to contribute back to a project. This is the best option for tech enthusiasts who are new to the OSS community and haven't aquired the necessary programming or troubleshooting skills to actively work on a project of their own or volunteer to help other developers. It does not have to be any crazy amount either. It would help a vast majority of OSS developers out there if even 50% of the users of their projects would donate One US Dollar a month to the developers. Most projects in reality is just one person maybe 2 or 3 more at best developing their software.
	
2. Volunteering
	- Giving your time to a project is a very satisfying aspect of contribution. This is a great option for those who have aquired the skills to code. Just being part of developing, writing, testing and delivering an excellent OSS project can give one an awesome sense of pride and ownership knowing you actively help create this project used by so many and possibly make their lives easier in this old World.

3. Testing and bug reporting
	- This is really an excellent way to contribute back to a project and is my personal favorite. This is for the techies out there who have been around long enough to pick up some skills and while maybe not be able to create a project from the ground up, but can test the hades out of one. It is, IMHO, the most important stage in your training to become a developer yourself. Being able to take the errors you get while clicking and clacking every which way but loose on the software, dig into your logs and really nail down what you truly think is causing the specific error you find and report that back to the developers in a detailed description of issue and other useful info. This is my favorite because, while not hard, but testing does take up a vast majority of development time. The added bonus of contributing this way is it will give you that sense of pride and will definately help hone your skills to become an active developer yourself while freeing up a TREMENDOUS amount of time so developers can create thier vision.
	
	
*One last thought*
I do apologize if I seem rude for creating this, but I had ZERO help when I started with lots of negativity when trying to ask question. I ignored the haters, found a project I like and believed in and put into motion the extact steps I laid out in the 3 steps listed above and still practice it to this day. It made me a better programmer and I still have a long way to go. I think I will get there.

:moneybag: **Donations** :moneybag:

If you use this plugin and would like to show your appreciation by buying me a cup of coffee, I surely would appreciate it. A regular cup of Joe is sufficient, but a Starbucks Coffee would be better ... \

No Zelle in your banks mobile app, no problem, just click [Paypal](https://paypal.me/texxasrulez?locale.x=en_US) and I can make a Starbucks run ... \
If you got the skills to and would prefer to donate your time to this project, I welcome it and NEED it .. 
	
	
I thank you and wish nothing but the best for all. Happy Programming!
