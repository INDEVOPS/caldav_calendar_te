#Issue Submittal Request 

Please provide as much detailed info as you can. Describe what you wanted to do, how you went about to do it click by click and what did happen. No detail is too small to leave out. \
**Please provide the following minimum information with your initial issue submittal:**
* Roundcube logs, installed plugins and versions.
* Nextcloud logs and version.
* OS info and system logs.
* PHP version with mods enabled and config.
* SQL Server Type and version.

**Providing the requested information upfront will help out both you and I tremendously.**
I promise to not just close issue if requested information is not provided with initial submittal, but if requested material is not provided within a a timely manner, this may cause the issue to be closed with no resolution provided if I cannot recreate it.  \
I apologize if I come off harsh, but honestly, because I do this totally **alone** and get **ZERO** dollars for my time, effort and little bits my soul, I think insisting that a little bit of info to be provided is not an outrageous request. \
To gather this information will take next to no time to do, but it will save **TONS** of time for developers to quickly find the source of issue and provide a solution.
