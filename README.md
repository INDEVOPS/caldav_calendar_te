# Roundcube_Skins
I have taken Larry skin and modified it so there are more colors to choose from. Larry Skin has the best layout in my opinion, so why reinvent the wheel when all I want is a color change.

I have also included skins for many popular plugins so you shouldn't have to make your own. If you need help with a plugin not available with this, please message me and ask. I just might can help you out ... 

The Larry Skin from Roundcube 1.3 was used, so you must be running RC 1.3 or higher.
