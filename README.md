This is a fork of Kolab and FasterIT calendars combining the best of both and using the sabre from Nextcloud to work with it. 
It will sync already existing calendars. If you want more than the default, you must add calendar within Nextcloud
and then go back to Roundcube to add it there. From Roundcube, you can add, edit and delete events and will be in sync
with Nextcloud.

This is also compatible with RCMCARDDAV as I use it to sync my contacts with Nextcloud to Roundcube as well.

If anyone would like to help out with this, I would appreciate it.
